Inspiration
We realised that the quality of connections in the digital age has dwindled progressively with time. In the hope of strengthening community relations and boost quality of mental health, we decided to make this platform to encourage more face to face interactions in third spaces.

What it does
The app provides users with gamified reward based incentives which motivates users to attend more events. Sponsors of Meet.point are granted adspace on both the event page, livestream and at the physical location.

How we built it
React and stream.place

Challenges we ran into
Integrating stream.place into our application.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Adding adspaces to the live stream

What we learned
Third spaces have been dying a lot. Video streaming integration is not as simple as we thought it would be.

What's next for Meet.Point
Fleshing out the ad spaces more fully.
